# Monster-Chase-Game

My first game made using unity.
This game was made by following a Youtube tutorial on unity game development.

However, after the completion of the tutorial, i went ahead and added features as i found fancy.

I would like to thank freecodecamp [https://www.freecodecamp.org] for providing me guidance and resources to build this project.
